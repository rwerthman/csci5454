			\textbf{Pseudocode}
			\begin{verbatim}
			def randbit():
			  while true:
			    (bitA, p) = probefluxcapacitor()
			    (bitB, p) = probefluxcapacitor()
			    if bitA does not equal bitB:
			      return bitA
			
			\end{verbatim}
			
			\textbf{Correctness}\\

			If the bits were uniformly random then a $1$ or a $0$ would be equally probable.  
			This would mean that the probability that either one would occur would need to be $\frac{1}{2}$ in order to be uniformly random.\\
			\\
			For the problem we are given that $P(1) = p$ and $P(0) = (1-p)$.  
			The first thing we have to figure out is how do we make an algorithm such that the probability of returning a 1 is equal 
			to the probability of returning a 0.  The second thing we have to figure out is how do we make sure the final probability for any run of randbit() is equal $\frac{1}{2}$.\\
			\\
			Notice the probability of two independent events, $A$ and $B$, occurring together is $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$ \cite{1}.
			If we let those two events be the probability of randbit() returning a 1, $P(1)$, and the probability of randbit() returning a 0, $P(0)$, 
			then we can say that the probability of them both occurring, $P(1 \cap 0)$, is $p \cdot (1-p)$.  
			This helps because we know that one call to probefluxcapacitor() will either return $p$, for bit value 1, or $(1-p)$, for bit value 0.  
			But if we combine two calls to probefluxcapacitor() sequentially and then compare the results we can create a probability like $P(1 \cap 0)$.\\
			\\
			Two calls to probefluxcapacitor() could result in 4 four combinations:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item $P(1 \cap 1) = p \cdot p$\\
				\item $P(0 \cap 0) = (1-p) \cdot (1-p)$\\
				\item $P(1 \cap 0) = p \cdot (1-p)$\\
				\item $P(0 \cap 1) = (1-p) \cdot p$\\
			\end{itemize}
			The pseudocode above only returns a bit if the probability combination was $p \cdot (1-p)$ or $(1-p) \cdot p$ which are in fact equal to each other.
			This tells us that returning a 1 --- bitA is 1 and bitB is 0 --- and returning a 0 --- bitA is 0 and bitB is 1 --- have equal probability now.  
			And since the if statement only looks at two possible combinations from the two calls to probefluxcapacitor() 
			and out of only one of those possible combinations will a 1 be returned, the probability of returning a 1, $P(1)$, is $\frac{1}{2}$.\\

			\textbf{Runtime}\\
			\\
			In order to find the running time of a randomize algorithm, we need to look at the expectation of the running time.
			The two calls to probefluxcapacitor() each take $O(1)$ because they are just looking at at most two numbers. 
			The checking of the two bits in the if statement is also $O(1)$.  
			This means that one time through the loop takes $O(1)$.
			The probability of getting out of the while loop and returning is $p \cdot (1-p)$ for a 1 or $(1-p) \cdot p$ for a 0.\\
			\\
			Let $X$ be the indicator random variable associated with the returning of randbit().  
			$X_1$ means a 1 is returned and $X_0$ means a 0 is returned.  
			This also means $E[X_1] = P(1)$, the probability of 1 being returned, and $E[X_0] = P(0)$, the probability of 0 being returned.
			This gives us
			\begin{align*}
			E[X] &= \sum_{i=0}^{1} E[X_i]\\
			&= E[X_0] + E[X_1]\\
			&= p \cdot (1-p) + (1-p) \cdot p\\
			&= 2p(1-p)\\
			\end{align*}
			This means the running time of randbit() is $O(2p(1-p) \cdot 1) = O(2p(1-p))$.
